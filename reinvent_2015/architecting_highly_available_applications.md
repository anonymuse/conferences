re:Invent 2015 - Bootcamp - Architecting Highly Available Applications on AWS  In Session

"Everything fails all of the time"

Design for Availability
Assume everything fails and work backwards
Avoid single point of failure
Implement elasticity
Design loosely coupled architecture

What is HA?
Availability: percentage of time that an application does work
Loss of availabilty:

- app is offline, unreachable or partially available.
- app is slow to use
- planned and unplanned

HA is:
Fault tolerance
built in redundancy
fault tolerance

Scalability
accommodate growth without changing design
scalability doesn’t guarantee availability

Disaster recovery

HA & DR
HA is the other end of the DR continuum
Don’t define RTO/RPO, design for continuous availability
Goal: application never goes down
  Elimiinate single points of failure
  Design self-healing applications
  Use graceful degradation
Traditional IT says that HA is very expensive and is only suitable for mission critical applications

AWS offers multiple services, isolated and redundant datacenter.t psetd s

Inherently fault tolerant:
PaaS

Fault tolerant if done correctly:
Iaas

Always do fault tolerance services
Where possible, use platform services instead of rolling your own
Service availability is built in.

Examples:
  - SES outobound email
  - SQS: queues
  -DynamoDB: NoSQL
